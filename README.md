## Notes

The data assembled here was taken from the etymological dictionary by Kluge (later maintained by Seebold) in a version from 2002 (as indicated in the source). In this digitized version, several cognates of German with English and Dutch along with proto-forms in Proto-Germanic are given in sporadic form. These cognates were extracted and later phonetically aligned in order to experiment with them, with the [EDICTOR](https://digling.org/edictor/) tool. A mapping to [Concepticon](https://concepticon.clld.org) was not carried out, but could be added at a later state. The "concepts" are thus just the cognate sets represented by the Proto-Germanic proto-form.
